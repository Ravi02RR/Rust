## 📦 Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by following the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## 🛠️ Check Rust Version

To verify that Rust is installed and check which version you're using, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
rustc --version
```

This will display something like:

```bash
rustc 1.70.0 (a0c201f13 2023-10-01)
```
This will formate the code

```bash
rustfmt main.rs
```



## 📚 Access Rust Documentation

Rust's official documentation is full of useful resources to help you along the way. You can open the local version of the documentation by using this command:

```bash
rustup doc
```

This will open the comprehensive Rust documentation in your default browser, including:
- 🧑‍💻 The Rust Programming Language Book
- 📖 Rust Reference
- 📜 Cargo (Rust's package manager)
- 📈 The Rustonomicon (for unsafe Rust programming)
